# Etch-a-Sketch
The Odin Project Foundations course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

## The problem
- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript
- Set up a 'hover' effect so that the grid divs change colour when your mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a pop-up prompt asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
- Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before, creating a new sketch pad (user limit max of 100)
