An interactive drawing application based off the famous Etch-a-Sketch, powered by JavaScript. The user can choose a grid size and toggle black and white or rainbow colouring. There are buttons to create a new grid of the user's chosen size, and to clear the current grid of all coloured-in cells.

A modal pop-up box appears and disappears as required by the user.
